# Project1

This project is a weather app that gives you useful recommendations on what to wear based on the weather forecast. Each recommended clothing item is clickable and on click will give you ten purchasable clothing options to browse. 

This app uses the WeatherBit API as well as The Etsy API. 

The idea behind it was create something where you can take a quick glance and know what you need to wear to dress weather appropriately that day.
